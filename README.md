# Welcome to my profile!

## Who I am
~~There used to be a big section here saying who I am, what I've done etc, but it was out of date and given that all the information was already on my website I didn't feel like maintaining the same information in two places, and I couldn't be arsed to think up some way to automate/share the information between the two.

~~So, if you wanna know who I am head over to https://whiskee.me/
