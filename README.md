# Welcome to my profile!

## Who I am
I'm Whiskee or, if you're here from a more profressional background, Liam.
I started studying Development during my free-time when I was ~12, first learning LUA to create scripts for [ComputerCraft](https://github.com/dan200/ComputerCraft) and Addons for Garry's Mod.

At 16 I started An apprenticeship a Web Developer, and within less than a year I dropped out of that to work as a Full-stack Web Developer.

I have a background in Javascript and PHP, using frameworks from Vue.js to Laravel. I don't do much backend development anymore, as I've moved my focus onto frontend.

## A quick heads-up
Majority of my repos are private, sorry! Most of them contain sensitive work; understandably I'd like to prevent these from leaking.

If you're a recruiter or interviewer, please use my formal contact details at the bottom of this readme, and we can try to sort out some form of temporary access.

## Projects I've worked on

JaxBot is a discord bot purpose-built for a gaming community I manage.

It can record users, warnings given by staff, applications, and provide detailed logs on its actions. Itâ€™s powered by Node.js and uses AWS RDS for data storage.

It also has a HTTPS server, with a signed SSL certificate, which is used as REST API for a work-in-progress web application that will be available to our users and staff (staff having options to make actions from the web app, rather than in discord).

You can find more info, and check him out yourself, [here](https://www.tophat-gaming.co.uk/jax).

_NOTE: A Discord account and being a member of the TopHat Community Server is necessary for access to the web app._

### Plutonium Game Launcher UI
The UI for the [Plutonium](https://plutonium.pw/) Game Launcher is a very basic HTML website, being rendered by (a _very_ old version of) Ultralight. Due to Ultralight having worse support than Internet Explorer (not a joke, we ran tests, it _sucked_) I had difficulties making something that looked nice while also working around the numerous limitations. However, with time and perseverance, we got it finished, and to this day, the UI is still used.
